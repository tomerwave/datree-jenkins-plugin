You can pass the following parameters to your `datree` step.

#### `datreeInstallation` (required)

Datree Installation Name. As configured in "[2. Configure a Datree Installation](#2-configure-a-datree-installation)".

#### `targetFile` (required)

The file we want to validate on.

#### `output` (optional, default: *none*)

Define an output format.

#### `policy` (optional)

Policy name to run against.

#### `schemaVersion` (optional, default: `1.18.0`)

Sets the Kubernetes version to validate against. Defaults to 1.18.0.

## 4. Run a Build and Enjoy Datree Preventing Misconfigurations

- Run a new build.
- Go to the build's page.
- Watch Datree preventing misconfigurations, by validating policies and more...

### Failed Installations

By default, Datree Installations will download Datree's binaries over the network
from [Datree.io Github Releases](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/releases/). If this fails there may be a network or
proxy issue. If you cannot fix the issue, you can use a [Manual Installation](#manual-installations)
instead.
